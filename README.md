### MultiModal Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the MultiModal Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis using multiple data modalities, such as text, audio, and visual data. The project aims to improve sentiment prediction accuracy by leveraging the complementary information from these different modalities.

#### Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, which involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a given piece of text, audio, or visual content. By combining multiple modalities, this project seeks to enhance the robustness and accuracy of sentiment analysis models.

#### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles preprocessing of text, audio, and visual data.
  - Converts raw data into suitable formats for model training and evaluation.

- **Multimodal Fusion**:
  - Implements techniques to combine information from different modalities.
  - Explores early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion strategies.

- **Model Training**:
  - Utilizes deep learning models to train on multiple modalities.
  - Employs models like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers for text, and CNNs for visual data.

- **Sentiment Prediction**:
  - Provides sentiment prediction based on the combined input from multiple modalities.
  - Outputs sentiment scores or classifications for the input data.

- **Evaluation and Metrics**:
  - Includes evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
  - Compares results across different fusion strategies and modalities.

Multimodal Sentiment Analysis has gained
significant attention in Machine Learning. It's popular because
it not only provides better results and a deeper understanding
of context but also offers a valuable alternative to analyzing
just one type of data. In recent years, there has been a growing
focus on this area, with the emergence of new datasets and
advanced models designed to handle the complexities of
analyzing emotions from different types of data. This paper
presents an innovative approach for real-time emotion analysis
using diverse inputs: text, images, videos, and audio. We begin
by establishing baseline models and curating datasets for
thorough evaluation. Our research introduces three cuttingedge deep learning techniques – Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Visual Geometry Group Networks (VGG),
and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) – to enhance sentiment
analysis accuracy. Additionally, we integrate YOLOv5 for
sophisticated image processing, Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC)-based frameworks for audio analysis,
and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for
text interpretation. Uniquely, we transform audio into text,
allowing for dual-mode evaluation – as audio and text – using
our NLP models. Our study critically examines factors often
neglected in emotion analysis, like the impact of varying data
sources and the system's performance in different scenarios.
The results of our research significantly deviate from existing
methodologies by offering a more holistic and versatile
framework. Our framework not only sets a standard for future
research but also emphasizes the essential considerations
needed for effective real-time emotion analysis
across various modes
